STEPS:
    1. Build Docker image: docker build --tag 'tremend/task2' .
    2. Run docker container in interactive mode: docker run -it 'tremend/task2'
    3. Test what you have to test

I'm not sure what is exactly required for bonus for this task, as the provided
application uses just one environment variable. Anyway, Dockerfile or Docker
Compose does not offer proper built-in means to store sensitive information in
environment variables. To store securely such information (e.g. passwords), we
should use Docker Secrets (in Swarm mode) or even Kubernetes. A way to enhance
the security of passwords storage, we can encrypt the files which contain
sensitive infomration.
