I'm not sure what is exactly required for bonus for this task, as the provided
application uses just one environment variable. Anyway, Dockerfile or Docker
Compose does not offer proper built-in means to store sensitive information in
environment variables. To store securely such information (e.g. passwords), we
should use Docker Secrets (in Swarm mode) or even Kubernetes. A way to enhance
the security of passwords storage, we can encrypt the files which contain
sensitive infomration.
