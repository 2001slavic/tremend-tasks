I've decided to compose the mysql container with an adminer database frontend
to ease the view, debugging and inspection of the database. Also, in adminer,
the average salary query can be tested. Two users are set up (root/admin)
(scott/tiger). The user scott has all privileges only for 'company' database
(see user-privileges.sql)

Fixed a mistake in company.sql (commented)
